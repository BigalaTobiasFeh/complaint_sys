# NAHPi Complaints - Authentication System Implementation

## 🎉 Implementation Complete!

The comprehensive authentication system has been successfully implemented with Supabase integration. Here's what has been built:

## ✅ What's Implemented

### 1. **Authentication Infrastructure**
- ✅ Supabase client configuration with SSR support
- ✅ Authentication service with role-based login
- ✅ React context for authentication state management
- ✅ Protected routes middleware
- ✅ Environment configuration

### 2. **Database Schema**
- ✅ Complete database schema with all required tables
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- ✅ User roles: Student, Admin, Department Officer
- ✅ Department structure with 8 engineering departments
- ✅ Complaint management tables (ready for future implementation)

### 3. **User Authentication**
- ✅ **Student Login**: Matricule + Password
- ✅ **Admin Login**: Email + Password  
- ✅ **Department Officer Login**: Email + Password
- ✅ **Student Registration**: Complete 2-step process with verification
- ✅ **Password Recovery**: Email-based reset functionality

### 4. **Dashboard Integration**
- ✅ **Student Dashboard**: Personalized with real user data
- ✅ **Role-based Redirects**: Automatic routing to appropriate dashboards
- ✅ **User Profile Display**: Shows matricule, department, year of study
- ✅ **Logout Functionality**: Secure sign-out with redirect

### 5. **Security Features**
- ✅ **Route Protection**: Middleware prevents unauthorized access
- ✅ **Role Verification**: Users can only access their designated areas
- ✅ **Session Management**: Automatic session refresh and validation
- ✅ **CSRF Protection**: Built-in with Supabase

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Database Setup
1. Go to your Supabase project: https://qbxgswcslywltbuoqnbv.supabase.co
2. Navigate to the SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `database/schema.sql`
4. Execute the SQL to create all tables and policies

### Step 2: Create Test Users (Optional)
Run the seeding script to create admin and department officer accounts:
```bash
npx ts-node scripts/seed-users.ts
```

### Step 3: Test the Application
The application is now running at: http://localhost:3001

## 🧪 Testing Authentication Flow

### Test Credentials (After Seeding)
**Admin Login:**
- URL: http://localhost:3001/admin/login
- Email: `admin@nahpi.edu`
- Password: `admin123456`

**Department Officer Login:**
- URL: http://localhost:3001/department/login
- Email: `officer.com@nahpi.edu` (Computer Engineering)
- Password: `officer123456`

**Student Registration & Login:**
- URL: http://localhost:3001/register
- Create a new student account with matricule format: `UBa25T1000`
- Login at: http://localhost:3001/login

### Expected Behavior
1. **Successful Login** → Redirects to appropriate dashboard
2. **Wrong Credentials** → Shows error message
3. **Wrong User Type** → Redirects to correct dashboard
4. **Unauthenticated Access** → Redirects to login
5. **Logout** → Returns to homepage

## 🎯 User Roles & Access

### Student (`/dashboard`)
- Login with matricule format: `UBa25T1000` (UBa + year + letter + 4 digits)
- View personal complaint statistics
- Access complaint submission (ready for implementation)
- Track complaint status
- Update profile information

### Admin (`/admin/dashboard`)
- Manage all users and complaints
- Generate reports
- System administration
- Department management

### Department Officer (`/department/dashboard`)
- View department-specific complaints
- Respond to assigned complaints
- Update complaint status
- Department communication

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Authentication Flow
```
1. User submits login form
2. AuthService validates credentials
3. Supabase authenticates user
4. Middleware checks route permissions
5. User redirected to appropriate dashboard
6. AuthContext provides user state to components
```

### Database Structure
- **users**: Base user information
- **students**: Student-specific data (matricule, department, etc.)
- **admins**: Admin permissions
- **department_officers**: Department assignments
- **departments**: 8 engineering departments
- **complaints**: Ready for complaint management features

## 🛡️ Security Implementation

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- Students can only see their own data
- Department officers see department-specific data
- Admins have full access
- All policies enforced at database level

### Route Protection
- Middleware validates authentication on every request
- Role-based access control
- Automatic redirects for unauthorized access
- Session validation and refresh

## 🚀 Next Steps

The authentication system is complete and ready for the next phase:

1. **Complaint Submission**: Implement complaint form and file uploads
2. **Complaint Management**: Admin and officer complaint handling
3. **Notifications**: Email and in-app notification system
4. **Reports**: Analytics and reporting dashboard
5. **File Management**: Document upload and storage

## 🎉 Success!

The authentication system is fully functional with:
- ✅ 3 distinct user types with separate login flows
- ✅ Role-based dashboard access
- ✅ Secure Supabase integration
- ✅ Complete user registration process
- ✅ Protected routes and middleware
- ✅ Responsive design for all devices

You can now test the complete authentication flow by visiting the application at http://localhost:3001!
